TITLE: Assignment on use of data types, simple operators (expressions)
Data Types in C:
It specifies the type of data that the variable can store like integer, character, floating, double, etc.
Each data type requires different amounts of memory and has some specific operations which can be
performed over it.
Int:
Integers are entire numbers without any fractional or decimal parts, and the int data type is used to
represent them.
It is frequently applied to variables that include values, such as counts, indices, or other numerical
numbers.
Char:
Individual characters are represented by the char data type. Typically used to hold ASCII or UTF-8
encoding scheme characters, such as letters, numbers, symbols, or commas. There are 256
characters that can be represented by a single char, which takes up one byte of memory. Characters
such as 'A', 'b', '5', or '$' are enclosed in single quotes.
Float:
To represent integers, use the floating data type. Floating numbers can be used to represent
fractional units or numbers with decimal places.
Double:
Use two data types to represent two floating integers. When additional precision is needed, such as
in scientific calculations or financial applications, it provides greater accuracy compared to float.
Operators:
An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions.
By definition, an operator performs a certain operation on operands. An operator needs one or more
operands for the operation to be performed.
software and Hardware requirements:
Software: windows OS 10,8,11, Turbo C++
Hardware: 4GB RAM, Hard disk
Problem statement:
a. Write C program to implement different data types in C with arithmetic operation.
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
Void main ()
{
Char x;
Int a,b,c;
Float k;
Printf(“enter any aplhabate”);
Scanf(“%c,&x);
Printf(“you entered alphabate %c,x);
Printf(“enter first no”);
Scanf(“%d”,&a)
Printf(“enter second no”);
Scanf(“%d”,&b);
Printf(“enter any no”);
Scanf(“%f”,&k);
C=a+b;
Printf(“addition is %d”,c);
C=a-b;
Printf(“substraction is %d”,c);
C=a*b;
Printf(“multiplication is %d”,c);
C=a/b;
Printf(“division is %d”,c);
C=a%b;
Printf(“Remainder is %d”,c);
Getch();
}
b. Write C program to implement different types of operators,
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
Void main()
{
Int x,y,z;
Printf(“enter first value”);
Scanf(“%d”,&x);
Printf(“enter second value”);
Scanf(“%d”,&y);
If (x==y)
{
Z=x+y;
Prinf(“%d”,z);
}
If(x==3 && y==7)
{
Z=x-y;
Printf(“%d”,z);
}
If(x>=25 || y<=100)
{
Z=x*y;
Printf(“%d”,z);
}
If(x!=y)
{
Printf(“x and y are not equal”);
}
Getch();
}
